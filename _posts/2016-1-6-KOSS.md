title: KWOC 2016-17

  About a month ago, I set forth my first venture into the world of Open Source Programming. Clueless as I was, I realize that this journey engulfed in it a plethora of joy and blissful amusement.  
  
  I had heard a lot about Open Source by this time, but I never exactly knew what is was. KWOC provided me with this great opportunity and the 'Initiation Energy' to finally get started. The Intro workshop and interactions with mentors set a great platform and made sure I was good to go throughout the holidays.  
  
  Throughout the span of a month, I got a chance to work on the project [La-Z-Boy](https://github.com/madan96/La-Z-Boy) by [Rishabh Madan](https://github.com/madan96). La-Z-Boy initailly was a web-scrapper which got you the TV schedule of your desired Channel and also fetches the IMDB rating for each programme. I majorly worked on adding a new functionality: **to get the 5 highest rated movies on TV for the desired Genre along with channel name and time of the programme.** I made a total of 4 commits during the process.

  La-Z-Boy further had features like saving the schedule in a pdf format.  Also, many improvements have been made since.  
  
  In all, I really cherished the experience. Special thanks to Rishabh for guiding me throughout the project and all the invaluable suggestions and corrections he made. A thanks to all of the KOSS team for putting up such a phenomenal event. 
  
  This was my arrival to the world of Open Source. I hope there's a lot more to come!
